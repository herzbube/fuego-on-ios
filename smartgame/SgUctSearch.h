/** @defgroup sguctgroup Monte Carlo tree search
    Game-independent Monte Carlo tree search using UCT.

    The main class SgUctSearch keeps a tree with statistics for each node
    visited more than a certain number of times, and then continues with
    random playout (not necessarily uniform random).
    Within the tree, the move with the highest upper confidence bound is
    chosen according to the basic UCT formula:
    @f[ \bar{X}_j + c \sqrt{\frac{\log{n}}{T_j(n)}} @f]
    with:
    - @f$ j @f$ the move index
    - @f$ X_{j,\gamma} @f$ reward for move @f$ j @f$ at sample @f$ \gamma @f$
    - @f$ n @f$ number of times the father node was visited
    - @f$ T_j(n) @f$ number of times the move has been played
    - @f$ c @f$ an appropriate constant

/** @page sguctsearchlockfree Lock-free mode in SgUctSearch

The basic idea of the lock-free mode in SgUctSearch is to share a tree between
multiple threads without using any locks. Because of specific requirements on
the memory model of the hardware platform, lock-free mode is an optional
feature of the SgUctSearch and needs to be enabled explicitly.

@section sguctsearchlockfreetree Modifying the Tree Structure

The first change to make the lock-free search work is in the handling of
concurrent changes to the structure of the tree. SgUctSearch never deletes
nodes during a search; new nodes are created in a pre-allocated memory array.
In the lock-free algorithm, each thread has its own memory array for creating
new nodes. Only after the nodes are fully created and initialized, are they
linked to the parent node. This can cause some memory overhead, because if
several threads expand the same node only the children created by the last
thread will be used in future simulations. It can also happen that some of the
children that are lost already received value updates; these updates will be
lost.

The child information of a node consists of two variables: a pointer to the
first child in the array, and the number of children. To avoid that another
thread sees an inconsistent state of these variables, all threads assume that
the number of children is valid if the pointer to the first child is not null.
Linking a parent to a new set of children requires first writing the number of
children, then the pointer to the first child. The compiler is prevented from
reordering the writes by declaring these variables as volatile.

@section sguctsearchlockfreevalues Updating Values

The move and RAVE values are stored in the nodes as counts and mean values.
The mean values are updated using an incremental algorithm. Updating them
without protection by a mutex can cause updates of the mean to be lost with or
without increment of the count, as well as updates of the mean occurring
without increment of the count. It could also happen that one thread reads the
count and mean while they are written by another thread, and the first thread
sees an erroneous state that exists only temporarily. In practice, these
faulty updates occur with a low probability and will have only a small effect
on the counts and mean values. They are intentionally ignored.

The only problematic case is if a count is zero, because the mean value is
undefined if the count is zero, and this case has a special meaning at several
places in the search. For example, the computation of the values for the
selection of children in the in-tree phase distinguishes three cases: if the
move count and RAVE count is non-zero, the value will be computed as a
weighted linear combination of both mean values, if the move count is zero,
only the RAVE mean is used, and if both counts are zero, a configurable
constant value, the first play urgency, is used. To avoid this problem, all
threads assume that a mean value is only valid if the corresponding count is
non-zero. Updating a value requires first writing the new mean value, then the
new count. The compiler is prevented from reordering the writes by declaring
the counts and mean values as volatile.

@section sguctsearchlockfreeplatform Platform Requirements

There are some requirements on the memory model of the platform to make the
lock-free search algorithm work. Writes of certain basic types (size_t, int,
float, pointers) must be atomic. Writes by one thread must be seen by other
threads in the same order. The IA-32 and Intel-64 CPU architectures, which are
used in most modern standard computers, guarantee these assumptions. They also
synchronize CPU caches after writes. (See
<a href="http://download.intel.com/design/processor/manuals/253668.pdf">
Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual</a>, chapter
7.1 Locked Atomic Operations and 7.2 Memory Ordering). */

/** @page sguctsearchweights Estimator weights in SgUctSearch
    The weights of the estimators (move value, RAVE value) are chosen by
    assuming that the estimators are uncorrelated and modeling the mean
    squared error of estimator @f$ i @f$ by a function that depends on the
    number of samples and parameter constants, which represent the variance
    and bias of the estimator and need to be determined experimentally:

    @f[
    w_i = \frac{1}{Z} \frac{1}{{\rm MSE}_i}
    \qquad Z = \sum_i \frac{1}{{\rm MSE}_i}
    \qquad {\rm MSE}_i = \frac{c_{\rm variance}}{N_i} + c_{\rm bias}^2
    @f]

    Note that this formula is nearly equivalent to the formula suggested
    by David Silver on the Computer Go mailing list for the case of two
    estimators (move value and RAVE value) and used in newer versions of MoGo.
    However, MoGo uses the measured variance of the current RAVE value (for
    both the move weight and RAVE weight) instead variance parameter
    constants.

    The formula is then reformulated to use different constants that describe
    the initial steepness and final asymptotic value of the unnormalized
    weight:

    @f[
    Z w_i =
    \frac{c_{\rm initial}}
         {\frac{1}{N} + \frac{c_{\rm initial}}{c_{\rm final}}}
    @f]

    with:
    - @f$ N @f$ sample count of the estimator
    - @f$ c_{\rm initial} @f$ Initial weight parameter; this is they weight if
      @f$ N = 1 @f$ and @f$ c_{\rm final} \gg c_{\rm initial} @f$
    - @f$ c_{\rm final} @f$ Final weight parameter; this is they weight if
      @f$ N \rightarrow \infty @f$

    For the move value, @f$ c_{\rm bias} = 0 @f$, and the variance can become
    part of the normalization constant, so the weight is simply
    @f$ N_{\rm move} @f$.
    If no estimator has a sample count yet, the first-play-urgency parameter
    is used for the value estimate. */

/** @page sguctsearchproven Proven Nodes in SgUctSearch

    When expanding a node (or computing knowledge at a node) it is
    possible the derived class can prove that the state corresponding
    to the node is a proven win or loss. Note this differs from a
    terminal node since a terminal node by definition has no children,
    whereas a proven node can have any number of children.

    Any in-tree phase that encounters a proven node is immediately
    terminated and the result passed back up the tree just as if a
    playout (with the value corresponding to the proven value) had
    been performed.

    The existence of proven nodes in a SgUctTree does not change the
    move selection in any way. For example: a node with both winning
    and losing children will continue to select children without
    regard to their proven value. This means losing children will not
    be avoided and winning children will not be chosen except as a
    result of the playouts recorded as those children are visisted
    (the values of which would now be perfectly accurate).

    Proven values are not currently passed up the tree like in a
    min-max search. It would be possible to pass back winning moves,
    that is, mark the parent of winning moves as winning, but it is
    not possible mark a node as losing if all its moves are
    losing. This is because it is possible progressive widening (or
    other heuristics) are being used by the derived state and in such
    a case it may not be true that all the current children being
    losses implies the parent state is a loss. */
