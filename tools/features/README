Tools for creating and using features learned from game records

Workflow:
1. Write code to define features. See fuego/features for examples
2. Collect game records in sgf format. Partition the games into three disjoint sets:
a. train (the largest), b. validate, and c. test
3. Use the gogui-statistics tool in combination with the Fuego GTP command features_wistuba_file to create a file features.txt in the current directory.
See sample script below.
4. rename the file to e.g. my.features
5. use validation set of sgf files to create a validation file features.txt in the current directory. See sample script below.

Sample script for step 3:
This uses all games from the 21st century (years following the pattern 20*)
to define features.

setenv COLLECTION <your-path>/badukmovies-pro-collection
foreach YEARPATH ($COLLECTION/20*)
echo $YEARPATH
foreach GAMEDIR ($YEARPATH/*)
echo $GAMEDIR
gogui-statistics -program $FUEGO -commands "features_wistuba_file" -size 19 \
-quiet -force $GAMEDIR/*sgf
end
end
mv features.txt 2000-2013.features

Sample script for step 5:
This uses the games from 1999 to define the validation set.
